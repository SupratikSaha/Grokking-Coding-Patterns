    "\n",
    "We are given an undirected graph that has characteristics of a k-ary tree. In such a graph, we can choose any node as the root to make a k-ary tree. The root (or the tree) with the minimum height will be called Minimum Height Tree (MHT). There can be multiple MHTs for a graph. In this problem, we need to find all those roots which give us MHTs. Write a method to find all MHTs of the given graph and return a list of their roots. <br/>\n",
