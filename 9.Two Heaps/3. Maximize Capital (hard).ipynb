    "Given a set of investment projects with their respective profits, we need to find the most profitable projects. We are given an initial capital and are allowed to invest only in a fixed number of projects. Our goal is to choose projects that give us the maximum profit. Write a function that returns the maximum total capital after selecting the most profitable projects. <br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "We can start an investment project only when we have the required capital. Once a project is selected, we can assume that its profit has become our capital. <br/>\n",

    "Input: Project Capitals=[0,1,2], Project Profits=[1,2,3], Initial Capital=1, Number of Projects=2 <br/>\n",

    "    With initial capital of ‘1’, we will start the second project which will give us profit of ‘2’. Once we selected our first project, our total capital will become 3 (profit + initial capital). <br/>\n",
